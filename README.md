A powershell script that turns off (puts to sleep) PC monitor. It disables any input a few seconds before, during, and after the screen is turns off to prevent the screen from waking up again as a result of a peripheral input being sent straight after the sleep command is ran. 
This lets you turn off wireless mice without waking up the screen via any input the off switch produces. My Logitech G305 seems to send an input then I press the off button and wakes up the monitor, so I had to add the initial delay that lets me turn off my mouse before the screen in put to sleep - so it doesn't wake up.
